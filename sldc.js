// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";
const analysisOfRequirements = "Check what the users want implemented in the software";
const design = "What stack are we going to use, where is this software going to be used is it going to be on mobile only or could it just be a webApp";
const implementation = "Get a prototype working";
const testingAndIntegration = "Test the application and implement fixes that need to be added and add some features that were not added duing the implementaion phase";
const maintain = "Make sure the application is up to date and does not contain many bugs: Sometimes when working with with big projects you may need to refactor the code to make it run faster because sometimes there is more data then when the applicaion was first made";
